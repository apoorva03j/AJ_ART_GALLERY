        <p class="abt">Art was my hobby and my passion. It turned into my full-time job when my friends pointed out that I could go commercial if I had the time.
        After years of research and hardwork, I reluctantly stepped into selling prints online. I knew there was no turning back when the total number of
        orders reached 1K in less than a month. Within weeks, the demand increased as I had to switch to paintings and other forms of art with the help of other talented artists to keep up with the pace.
        <br>As reviews started pouring in from all over the city, with the help of friends and family, we spread out first to the state, and now we deliver all across India 
        which wouldn't have been possible without our amazing and efficient delivery partner - XXX couriers.
        Now, proud of the length we have come, we plan on expanding the online store to hopefully, create custom paintings and prints too.
